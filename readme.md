# running an R cluster
This is basically some startup scripting and tutorial on getting a cluster running on ec2. 
A lot of the actual documentation will be in the ipython document distributed in this file.

## Things you need to get started: 
an aws account
your aws secret and aws key
Search around and you will find lots of info on how to get that much done. 

install a virtual env for running the requisite python via the bootstrap.sh command included in this repo, or just install out of the requirements text directly.
You also need to setup ssh to work correctly. This works differetnly depending on the machine and I have no idea how to get it to work in windows.
